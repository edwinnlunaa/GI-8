This JavaScript code defines a function called exerciseForToday that allows setting and getting the exercise for the day. It uses closures to encapsulate the todayExercise variable, ensuring independent instances for different days.


How It Works:

The exerciseForToday function creates a closure containing two inner functions: setExercise and pullExercise. These functions allow setting and retrieving the exercise for the day.

setExercise: Sets the exercise for the day by updating the value of the todayExercise variable.
pullExercise: Retrieves the exercise for the day by returning a message "Today's exercise: [exercise]", where [exercise] is the value of the todayExercise variable.



Why It Works: 

Closures: Closures allow the inner functions (setExercise and pullExercise) to access the todayExercise variable even after the outer function (exerciseForToday) has finished. This ensures that each instance of exerciseForToday maintains its own todayExercise variable, preventing interference between different days' exercises.

Encapsulation: By encapsulating the todayExercise variable within the closure, the code attaches to the principle of encapsulation, making sure that the internal state of the function is not accessible from outside.

Independence: Each call to exerciseForToday creates a new closure with its own todayExercise variable, allowing for independent instances of the exercise for different days. This promotes modularity and reusability of the code.
