This JavaScript code defines a function called dividePizza that calculates how many slices of pizza each person would get when sharing a pizza evenly. It takes two parameters: the total number of slices of pizza (totalSlices) and the number of people sharing the pizza (totalPeople).

How It Works:

The dividePizza function divides the total number of slices by the total number of people to decide the number of slices each person would get. It then rounds the result to two decimal places using the toFixed(2) method to ensure precision.



Why It Works:

Division - By dividing the total number of slices by the total number of people, the function distributes the slices evenly between all individuals sharing the pizza.

Rounding - Rounding the calculated slices per person to two decimal places makes sure there is consistency and clarity in the output, providing a exact representation of the portion each person receives.

Interpolated String - The function returns an interpolated string that combines the calculated slices per person with the total number of slices of pizza, making the output easy to understand.
