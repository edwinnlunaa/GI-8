This code demonstrates how to create a closure in JavaScript to encapsulate Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of patients, allowing access to certain properties through public functions while keeping others private.

How It Works:

The code consists of a createPatient function that creates a closure encapsulating the patient's PII object. This PII object has two properties: name and SSN. But, only the name property is accessible through a public function called getName. The getSSN function is provided for consistency but always returns undefined, making sure that the SSN property is not accessible.


Why It Works: 

Encapsulating PII within a closure allows us to control access to sensitive information, such as the SSN, while still providing access to not so sensitive data like the patient's name. By only showing the necessary information through public functions, we prevent unauthorized access to important data and maintain data privacy and security.
